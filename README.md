p5js -- Small Projects, Key Concepts
------------------------------------
### Project branch organization and purpose (Note: Obviously, this explanation can be re-worded so that it is suitable to middle school students )
-------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>



1. Project features are branches where the actual work takes place.
2. All changes will be pushed to feature branches. 
3. If the feature's objective is reached, changes are merged to the develop
 branch and the feature branch is removed and a new feature branch can be
 created for new objectives. 
4. If feature branch objective is not reached, branch can be left for the future
 or removed. 
5. Branches will be project features and named according to issues created (note: issues are numbered, so branch features
 will have this issue number associated with it ) and should be related to a feature's objective. 

Note: instructions assume [git](https://git-scm.com/ "Official git site") is installed in your computer.
